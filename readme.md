# Bazaar Tools
Build your starter template from [Bazaar Next.js ecommerce template](https://mui.com/store/items/bazar-pro-react-ecommerce-template/)

Run this in your terminal
`bazaar set-root`
Then select a homepage

Above command will set your selected shop page as your root page. Also this will delete other unused layouts from `app` folder and page components from `page-sections` folders.
If you want to keep section components in `page-sections` folders use this command `bazaar set-root --keep-components`
